# Traffic Sign Classification 🚦

## Project Overview 🌟
This repository is dedicated to the development of a machine-learning model capable of classifying traffic signs. It uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recognize and classify traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Dataset.

## Dataset Description 📊
The dataset consists of thousands of images of traffic signs divided into training, testing, and validation sets. These images are preprocessed and labeled with corresponding traffic sign types.

- **Training set**: Used to train the model.
- **Validation set**: Used to tune the parameters and validate the model performance.
- **Test set**: Used to test the model after training.

## Installation and Setup 🔧
Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

* git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-sign-classification.git
* cd traffic-sign-classification
* pip install -r requirements.txt

## Data Preprocessing 🔄
The input images undergo several preprocessing steps:

* Shuffling: To randomize the order of input data.
* Grayscaling: To reduce complexity by converting images to grayscale.
* Normalization: To adjust the range of pixel intensity values.
  
# Model Architecture 🏗️
We use the LeNet architecture, a well-known CNN for image classification tasks, tailored to achieve over 90% accuracy on the validation set.

## Visualizations and Results 📈
Visual representations include:

* Accuracy and Loss Graphs: Track model performance across training epochs.
* Sample Predictions: Display predictions using test images.

## Testing the Model 🧪
The final model is tested using new images of German traffic signs to evaluate its real-world performance.
