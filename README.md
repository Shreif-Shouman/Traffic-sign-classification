# Traffic Sign Classification ðŸš¦

## Project Overview ðŸŒŸ
This repository is dedicated to the development of a machine learning model capable of classifying traffic signs. It uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recognize and classify traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Dataset.

## Dataset Description ðŸ“Š
The dataset consists of thousands of images of traffic signs divided into training, testing, and validation sets. These images are preprocessed and labeled with corresponding traffic sign types.

- **Training set**: Used to train the model.
- **Validation set**: Used to tune the parameters and validate the model performance.
- **Test set**: Used to test the model after training.

## Installation and Setup ðŸ”§
Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

* git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-sign-classification.git
* cd traffic-sign-classification
* pip install -r requirements.txt
